# Macroevolutionary time calibration

Phylogenomics analyses to estimate the divergence time between Anguilla and Conger. The dataset for these analyses is taken from Parey et al. (2023). Alignments are filtered by completeness, entropy, GC-content, and clock-like evolution. Third codon positions are removed. The timeline of elopomorph divergences is estimated with BEAST2 on the basis of Musilova et al. (2019; https://evoinformatics.group/repos/opsin_evolution/101g_nucl_conc_28bfossils.combined.tre).
