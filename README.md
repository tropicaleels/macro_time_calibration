# Macroevolutionary time calibration

Phylogenomics analyses to estimate the divergence time between the genera *Anguilla* and *Conger*. The dataset for these analyses is taken from Parey et al. ([2022](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.07.487469v1)). Alignments are filtered by completeness, entropy, GC-content, and clock-like evolution. Third codon positions are removed. The timeline of elopomorph divergences is estimated with BEAST2 on the basis of [Musilova et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aav4632) ([tree file](https://evoinformatics.group/repos/opsin_evolution/101g_nucl_conc_28bfossils.combined.tre)).
